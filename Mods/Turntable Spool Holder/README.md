# Turntable spool holder

This turns the spool on its side and uses a bearing to reduce drag on the filament to a minimum. 
I use polymaker spools predominantly so I made a spindle for it but it is parametric so you can
resize it easily to meet your needs using the provided fusion360 files. 

I used M3 hardware for the holes and reused the M5 hardware from the stock spool holder to attach
it to the machine. 

I used these cheap 608 skateboard bearings:

As with all of the cheap amazon bearings they are greese filled and dont spin very freely out of the
package. just hit them with isopropyl alchohol and spin them till it comes out and they free spin.
this should not take long to me maybe a minute per bearing. 

I lost a T-nut somewhere along the way and these worked as a replacement )try to avoid the $9 mistake )
